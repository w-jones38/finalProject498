You guys will need to install 'yarn' off the internet for this to work.
For Mac, just use 'brew install yarn'
For Windows, I can only wish you luck

Once you have yarn installed, go into finalProject498/frontend and run 'yarn install'

Once that has finished, run 'yarn start'


To run the docker image:
go to the directory with the docker file and run: 'docker-compose up'
